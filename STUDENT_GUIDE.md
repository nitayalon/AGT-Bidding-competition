## 🎯 Understanding the Competition

### Competition Structure

```
Stage 1: Qualification Round
├── All teams divided into 5-team arenas
├── Each arena plays 5 games
├── Top scorer from each arena advances to Stage 2
│
Stage 2: Championship Round
├── All qualified teams in single arena
├── Play 5 games
└── Final rankings determine winners
```

### Single Game Flow

```
Pre-Game: You receive
├── Your valuation vector (20 items with values)
├── List of 15 items that will be auctioned
├── Initial budget: 60 units
└── Unknown: The order items will be auctioned

During Game: For each of 15 rounds
├── System announces which item is being auctioned
├── You submit your bid (you have 2 seconds max)
├── Highest bidder wins, pays second-highest bid
└── All agents learn: winner identity + price paid

Post-Game: Calculate utility
└── Utility = Σ(values of items won) - Σ(prices paid)
```

### Key Rules

- **Auction Type**: Second-price sealed-bid (Vickrey auction)
- **Budget**: 60 units per game (does NOT carry over between games)
- **Timeout**: 2 seconds per bid decision
- **Information**: After each round, you learn winner + price (NOT all bids)
- **Scoring**: Total utility across all games in your stage

### Item Valuation Distribution

Each game, valuations are generated as follows:

- **6 items**: High-value for ALL teams (each team gets value U[10, 20])
- **4 items**: Low-value for ALL teams (each team gets value U[1, 10])
- **10 items**: Mixed values (each team gets value U[1, 20])

**Important**: You don't know which category each item belongs to! A high-value item in your valuation might be high-value for everyone (competitive) or only for you (less competitive).

## 🔧 Agent Interface Overview

### Required Class Structure

Every team must implement a class called `BiddingAgent` with these methods:

```python
class BiddingAgent:
    def __init__(self, team_id: str, valuation_vector: dict, 
                 budget: float, auction_items_sequence: list):
        """
        Initialize your agent at the start of each game.
        
        Args:
            team_id: Your unique team identifier (UUID)
            valuation_vector: Dict mapping item_id to your valuation
                Example: {"item_0": 15.3, "item_1": 8.2, ..., "item_19": 12.7}
            budget: Initial budget (always 60)
            auction_items_sequence: List of 15 item_ids that will be auctioned
                Example: ["item_3", "item_7", "item_12", ...]
                Note: You know WHICH items, not the ORDER
        """
        pass
    
    def bidding_function(self, item_id: str) -> float:
        """
        REQUIRED: Return your bid for the current item.
        This is called once per round.
        
        Args:
            item_id: The item being auctioned (e.g., "item_7")
        
        Returns:
            float: Your bid amount
                - Must be >= 0
                - Should be <= your current budget
                - Bids over budget are automatically capped
        
        Important:
            - You have 2 seconds maximum to return
            - Timeout or error = bid of 0
            - This is a SECOND-PRICE auction: winner pays second-highest bid
        """
        pass
    
    def update_after_each_round(self, item_id: str, winning_team: str, 
                                price_paid: float):
        """
        REQUIRED: Called after each auction round with public information.
        Use this to update your strategy, beliefs, or opponent models.
        
        Args:
            item_id: The item that was just auctioned
            winning_team: Team ID of the winner (empty string if no winner)
            price_paid: Price the winner paid (second-highest bid)
        
        Note:
            - You do NOT see all bids, only winner and price
            - Your budget is automatically updated by the system
            - Use this to learn about opponent behavior
        """
        pass
```

### Provided Attributes (Auto-managed)

These attributes are automatically maintained by the base class:

```python
self.team_id              # Your team identifier
self.valuation_vector     # Your valuations for all 20 items
self.budget               # Current remaining budget (updated automatically)
self.initial_budget       # Starting budget (60)
self.auction_items_sequence  # List of 15 items to be auctioned
self.utility              # Current utility (updated automatically)
self.items_won            # List of items you've won (updated automatically)
```

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create Your Team Directory

```bash
mkdir teams/your_team_name
cd teams/your_team_name
```

### Step 2: Copy the Template

Create `bidding_agent.py`:

```python
"""
Team: [Your Team Name]
Members: [Student 1, Student 2, Student 3]
Strategy: [Brief description]
"""

from typing import Dict, List


class BiddingAgent:
    def __init__(self, team_id: str, valuation_vector: Dict[str, float], 
                 budget: float, auction_items_sequence: List[str]):
        # Required attributes
        self.team_id = team_id
        self.valuation_vector = valuation_vector
        self.budget = budget
        self.initial_budget = budget
        self.auction_items_sequence = auction_items_sequence
        self.utility = 0
        self.items_won = []
        
        # Your custom attributes here
        self.rounds_completed = 0
        # Example: self.opponent_bids = {}
        # Example: self.price_history = []
        
    def _update_available_budget(self, item_id: str, winning_team: str, 
                                 price_paid: float):

        # System update (DO NOT REMOVE)
        self._update_available_budget(item_id, winning_team, price_paid)
        if winning_team == self.team_id:
            self.utility += (self.valuation_vector[item_id] - price_paid)
        
        # YOUR CODE HERE: Update beliefs, track opponent behavior, etc.
        self.rounds_completed += 1
        
        return True
    
    def bidding_function(self, item_id: str) -> float:
        """
        YOUR MAIN STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION
        
        Return your bid for the current item.
        """
        # Get your valuation for this item
        my_valuation = self.valuation_vector.get(item_id, 0)
        
        # IMPLEMENT YOUR STRATEGY HERE
        bid = my_valuation  # Simple truthful bidding (IMPROVE THIS!)
        
        # Ensure bid is valid
        bid = max(0, min(bid, self.budget))
        
        return bid
```

### Step 3: Implement Your Strategy

Replace the simple `bidding_function` with your strategy. Consider:

1. **Budget Management**: How much to spend now vs. save for later?
2. **Opponent Modeling**: Can you learn from observed prices?
3. **Value Assessment**: Which items are worth competing for?
4. **Risk Management**: When to bid aggressively vs. conservatively?

### Step 4: Test Your Agent

```bash
# Validate your agent
python main.py --mode validate --validate teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py

# Test against example agents
python simulator.py --your-agent teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py --num-games 10
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Agent

### Local Validation

Verify your agent implements the interface correctly:

```bash
python main.py --mode validate --validate teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Test bid successful: X.XX (took 0.XXXs)
✓ Agent validation PASSED
```

### Simulator Testing

Use the provided simulator to test against example strategies:

```bash
# Test against all example agents (10 games)
python simulator.py --your-agent teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py --num-games 10

# Test against specific opponent
python simulator.py --your-agent teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py \
                    --opponent examples/strategic_bidder.py --num-games 5

# Verbose output to see detailed game flow
python simulator.py --your-agent teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py \
                    --num-games 3 --verbose

# Test with different random seeds for consistency
python simulator.py --your-agent teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py \
                    --num-games 10 --seed 42
```

### Analyze Your Performance

The simulator generates a report showing:
- Win rate against each opponent
- Average utility per game
- Budget utilization
- Items won statistics
- Execution time analysis

## 💡 Strategy Development Tips

### Understanding Second-Price Auctions

In a standard second-price auction (without budget constraints):
- **Optimal Strategy**: Bid your true valuation
- **Why**: You win if your value > others, pay less than your value
- **With Budget Constraints**: This changes! You need to be more strategic

### Key Strategic Considerations

#### 1. Budget Pacing

```python
# Calculate how much budget per remaining round
rounds_remaining = len(self.auction_items_sequence) - self.rounds_completed
budget_per_round = self.budget / rounds_remaining

# Be more aggressive as game progresses
progress = self.rounds_completed / len(self.auction_items_sequence)
aggressiveness = 0.7 + (0.3 * progress)  # 70% to 100%
```

#### 2. Value Classification

```python
# Classify items based on your valuation
high_value_threshold = 12.0
low_value_threshold = 8.0

if my_valuation > high_value_threshold:
    # Might be competitive, bid carefully
    bid = my_valuation * 0.9
elif my_valuation < low_value_threshold:
    # Low value, bid conservatively
    bid = my_valuation * 0.5
else:
    # Medium value
    bid = my_valuation * 0.7
```

#### 3. Opponent Modeling

```python
# Track observed prices
self.observed_prices.append(price_paid)

# Estimate market competitiveness
avg_price = sum(self.observed_prices) / len(self.observed_prices)
max_price = max(self.observed_prices)

# Adjust strategy based on market
if avg_price > 10:  # Competitive market
    # Be more conservative on medium-value items
    pass
```

#### 4. Information Revelation

What you can learn from each round:
- **Price paid**: Indicates second-highest bid (at least)
- **Winner identity**: Track which teams are winning
- **No winner**: Everyone bid low (item not valuable to others)

```python
# Track opponent success
if winning_team != self.team_id and winning_team:
    self.opponent_wins[winning_team] = \
        self.opponent_wins.get(winning_team, 0) + 1
```

### Advanced Strategies

#### Bayesian Belief Updates

```python
# Maintain beliefs about opponent valuations
# Update after observing their bids (revealed when they win)
# Use to predict future competition
```

#### Shading Strategy

```python
# In second-price auctions with budgets, you might want to "shade" bids
# Bid less than true value to preserve budget
shading_factor = 0.8  # Bid 80% of valuation
bid = my_valuation * shading_factor
```

#### End-Game Strategy

```python
# Near end of game, spend remaining budget more aggressively
if rounds_remaining <= 3:
    # Less need to preserve budget
    bid = min(my_valuation, self.budget * 0.8)
```

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### 1. Timeout Errors

**Problem**: Your `bidding_function` takes > 2 seconds
```python
# BAD: Complex computation that might timeout
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    # Huge nested loops...
    for i in range(1000000):
        for j in range(1000000):
            # complex calculation
    return bid
```

**Solution**: Keep computation simple and fast
```python
# GOOD: Pre-compute what you can in __init__ or update_after_each_round
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    # Quick lookup or simple calculation
    return self.precomputed_bids.get(item_id, 0)
```

### 2. Budget Exhaustion

**Problem**: Spending all budget early, nothing left for later rounds
```python
# BAD: Always bidding full valuation
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    return self.valuation_vector[item_id]  # Might run out of budget!
```

**Solution**: Pace your budget
```python
# GOOD: Reserve budget for future rounds
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    rounds_left = 15 - self.rounds_completed
    max_bid_now = self.budget / max(1, rounds_left) * 1.5
    return min(self.valuation_vector[item_id], max_bid_now)
```

### 3. Not Updating State

**Problem**: Ignoring information from previous rounds
```python
# BAD: Not learning from observations
def update_after_each_round(self, item_id, winning_team, price_paid):
    self._update_available_budget(item_id, winning_team, price_paid)
    # Not tracking anything!
    return True
```

**Solution**: Learn from each round
```python
# GOOD: Track patterns and update beliefs
def update_after_each_round(self, item_id, winning_team, price_paid):
    self._update_available_budget(item_id, winning_team, price_paid)
    
    # Learn from observations
    self.price_history.append(price_paid)
    self.avg_price = sum(self.price_history) / len(self.price_history)
    
    return True
```

### 4. Invalid Return Values

**Problem**: Returning wrong type or invalid bid
```python
# BAD: Various errors
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    return None  # Error!
    return -5    # Negative bid!
    return "10"  # String instead of float!
```

**Solution**: Always return valid float
```python
# GOOD: Ensure valid return
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    bid = self.calculate_bid(item_id)
    return max(0.0, float(bid))  # Ensure non-negative float
```

### 5. Forgetting Budget Constraints

**Problem**: Not checking if you can afford your bid
```python
# BAD: Bidding more than available budget
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    return 100  # But budget might be only 10!
```

**Solution**: System caps bids automatically, but you should check:
```python
# GOOD: Respect budget
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    desired_bid = self.calculate_bid(item_id)
    return min(desired_bid, self.budget)
```

## 🐛 Debugging Guide

### Enable Verbose Logging

Test with verbose mode to see all decisions:

```bash
python simulator.py --your-agent teams/your_team_name/bidding_agent.py \
                    --num-games 1 --verbose
```

### Add Print Statements

```python
def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    my_val = self.valuation_vector[item_id]
    print(f"[{self.team_id}] Round {self.rounds_completed}: "
          f"Item {item_id}, Value={my_val:.2f}, Budget={self.budget:.2f}")
    
    bid = self.calculate_bid(item_id)
    print(f"[{self.team_id}] Bidding: {bid:.2f}")
    
    return bid
```

### Check Execution Time

```python
import time

def bidding_function(self, item_id):
    start = time.time()
    
    # Your strategy
    bid = self.calculate_bid(item_id)
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    if elapsed > 1.5:  # Warning if taking too long
        print(f"WARNING: Bid took {elapsed:.3f}s")
    
    return bid
```

### Test Edge Cases

```python
# Test with minimal budget
# Test with first/last rounds
# Test with all high-value items
# Test with all low-value items
```
